<center>What is this website?</center>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Many web sties today require users to log in with a password. It is hard to remember multiple different passwords, especially for sites that you rarely visit. As a result, users frequently employ the same password for multiple websites. While this is convenient, it means that if your password on one of those websites is compromised, all of your accounts are vulnerable.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The idea behind this website is to allow you to use a single master password to generate different passwords for each of the websites that you visit. The website takes a URL, a User Name, and a Master Password and generates a password that is unique to the user, but different for each website.</p>

<p>Because you are using a Master Password to generate different passwords for each website, the only password you will ever need to remember is your Master Password.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<center>Quick Start!</center>

<p></p>

<p>The simplest way to use this website is to generate passwords using the default settings. Once you&#39;ve entered the name of the website you need a password for, your Username, and your Master Password, all you need to do is press the button labeled &#39;Generate Password&#39; at the top of the button list.</p>

<p>This generates the website&#39;s unique password, and displays it at the top of the page. All you need to do now is to copy and paste the password into the password field of the requesting website.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<center>URL Settings page</center>

<p></p>

<p>Because of tightening security concerns and other reasons, many websites require a password to have a minimum length or allow only certain characters. Using the URL Settings Page you can create settings specialized for each website&#39;s password requirements.</p>

<p>The page display the URL at the top followed by a table containing the character selection options available. For each option excluding &#39;Number of Characters&#39; there are three available selections: &#39;none&#39;, &#39;a few&#39;, and &#39;at least one&#39;.</p>

<p>The &#39;none&#39; option will never allow those specific characters to appear in your generated password.</p>

<p>The &#39;1+&#39; option allows the specified characters to appear, and forces at least one of those characters to occur in your generated password.</p>

<p>After choosing your settings press the &#39;Generate Password&#39; button to generate your password using those settings. This website will save those settings for that URL, meaning that the settings get saved as the default settings for the specified website, and you will never have to visit this page again for this URL.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<center>Change Password Page</center>

<p></p>

<p>Many websites require you to change your password after a certain period of time, and security breaches of passwords aren&#39;t uncommon. Because of this, we&#39;ve added a &#39;Change Password&#39; button on the main page.</p>

<p>This button will force this website to generate a different password for the URL. Simply press the button and you will be taken to a different page, where you will be asked to confirm that you want to change the password. Once your confirm that you want to change your password, a new page will be shown with your old password and new password. Copy and Paste these passwords to the requesting website to change your password.</p>
